description: Execute one roadmap phase under the gated loop — build each item, verify it live (exercise the real thing per the project's profile), record learnings, and prove the phase with concrete evidence before starting the next. Use to work through a roadmap without drifting or self-declaring done.
---

Work the **current (NOW) phase** of `docs/plans/ROADMAP.md`, one item at a time, to the real definition of done.

## Per item
1. **Build** the smallest change that actually closes the gap (reuse before hand-rolling).
2. **Produce/run** it the project's real way (note the build/deploy traps — see the project's `build-deploy-gotchas`).
3. **Verify live** — run `/verify-goodbehavior`: exercise the real thing the way its consumer would, per the project's
   **profile** (software driven like a user through UI + backend; a dataset validated on real input; claims re-checked
   against sources; a delivered artifact walked + fact-checked), and capture that profile's evidence. A passing test
   alone is **not** verify.
4. **Record learnings** — any non-obvious trap, correction, or build/deploy fact → `/learn-goodbehavior`.
5. **Status** — mark the item done **only with evidence**; otherwise "partial/blocked" + log the blocker to the backlog.

## Gate before the next phase
Loop-review the phase until **every item has concrete evidence** (or is explicitly deferred to the backlog). Record
phase-level learnings. Only then advance. Don't carry an unverified item forward silently. Tag each item `✔` (firsthand
live evidence) or `⚠` (relayed/assumed — **not** done); a phase never advances on a `⚠` item.

## Standing-proceed (when granted)
If the user has granted **standing-proceed** for this plan, run the phases end to end **without per-item check-ins** —
the per-item loop above is unchanged (build → verify live → record → gate), you've just been trusted to run it unattended
against the agreed plan. Keep going; "should I continue?" is not a checkpoint, and length is not a reason to stop. Pause
to ask **only** for: a genuine design decision the plan doesn't settle, a real failure you can't resolve, or a
destructive/irreversible step (a push that deploys, a migration, anything you can't take back). When you pause, say which
of the three it is. Standing-proceed removes the pause between items, never a guardrail — a faked or skipped verify is the
one thing it must never buy.

## Discipline
- **Don't sidetrack.** Hit something off-track? Log it to `PRODUCTION-BACKLOG.md` and keep the throughline.
- **Don't fake or over-claim.** If you can't show it working, it isn't done — say so. Surface real failure output.
- **Don't over-build.** If an item is large + invisible (e.g. a pure refactor with no behavior change), flag it and
  consider the backlog rather than grinding; recommend, let the user decide.
- **Right-size verification to the change**, but never skip the live check on anything user-facing.
