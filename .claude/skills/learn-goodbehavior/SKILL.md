description: Capture a durable learning — a non-obvious trap, correction, or hard-won fact — so it isn't relearned. Use right after hitting or being corrected on something the next session would otherwise rediscover.
---

**Loop position:** called per item by `/gate-build-goodbehavior`, or whenever something non-obvious was learned.

Write a durable learning to project memory — `.claude/goodbehavior/memory/` (index `MEMORY.md`), unless the project
already keeps learnings elsewhere. One fact per file; check for an existing file on the same topic and
**update it rather than duplicate**.

**A memory retires when it stops being TRUE — never because the thing it describes got fixed.** A learning about a
bug you shipped a fix for stays live: the trap can recur, and the reasoning that found it is the durable part. Ship
the fix, then *update* the memory to say it's fixed and how — don't retire it. Getting this backwards throws away
exactly what the memory existed to preserve.

**When a learning is genuinely replaced** — it turned out wrong, or a later finding supersedes it — **collapse it
into the memory that replaces it** (one line of provenance there: what changed and when) and drop the stale file and
its index line. Don't leave two memories disagreeing, and don't keep a corrected fact alive as if it were still true.
If you are unsure whether it's superseded, **leave it** — an outdated memory you can still read beats a lost one.

The index (`MEMORY.md`) is loaded every session, so **its length is the real cost**, not the bodies (those are read
on demand). Keep one line per live memory and make that line say what it's *for*, so a reader can tell from the index
alone whether to open the file.

## What's worth recording
- **feedback** — a correction or confirmed-good approach from the user. Include the *why*.
- **gotcha** — a non-obvious trap (build/deploy quirk, stale-cache, an API that lies, a config that's bundled not
  read-at-runtime, access that's seeded-not-derived). Include how to detect + the fix.
- **project** — ongoing goals/decisions/constraints not derivable from the code or git history.
- **reference** — a pointer to an external resource (URL, dashboard, ticket).

Don't record what the repo already states (code structure, past fixes, git history, AGENTS.md). If asked to "remember"
something obvious, ask what was *non-obvious* about it and record that.

## Format (one file)
```
---
name: <kebab-slug>
description: <one line — used to decide relevance on recall>
metadata: { type: feedback | gotcha | project | reference }
---
<the fact. For feedback/gotcha, add **Why:** and **How to detect / apply:**. Link related learnings with [[their-name]].>
```
Then add a one-line pointer to the memory index (`.claude/goodbehavior/memory/MEMORY.md`): `- [Title](file.md) — hook`.

## Recall
At the start of real work, skim the index. A recorded learning that names a file/flag/endpoint reflects what was true
when written — **verify it still holds** before relying on it.
